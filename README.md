Home Assistant integration for [mijn.ista.nl](https://mijn.ista.nl) — the Dutch ista energy monitoring portal. Exposes your heating, hot/cold water, electricity, and gas consumption as sensors you can track, automate, and display on your dashboard.

---

## Quick install

**Step 1 — Add this repository to HACS:**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=aalaei&repository=ha-mijn-ista&category=integration)

**Step 2 — Set up the integration:**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mijn_ista)

> Both buttons require the [My Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/) companion service to be configured.

## What it does

Reads your consumption data from mijn.ista.nl and creates sensors in Home Assistant for every service (Heating, Electricity, Hot water, Cold water, Gas — whatever your property has):

| Sensor | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `{Service} Current` | Annual total for the current billing year |
| `{Service} Previous` | Annual total for the previous billing year |
| `{Service} Change` | Year-over-year change in % |
| `{Service} Building Avg` | Average consumption across your building |
| `{Service} {serial}` | Annual reading for one physical meter |
| `{Service} Month` | Latest month's total (prior months in attributes) |
| `{Service} Month Avg` | Latest month's building average |
| `{Service} {serial} Month` | Latest month for one physical meter |
| `Temperature` | Current billing period avg outdoor temperature (KNMI) |
| `Temperature Previous` | Previous billing period avg outdoor temperature |

All sensors are grouped under a single **ista NL** device per property in the Home Assistant device registry.

## Requirements

- A valid [mijn.ista.nl](https://mijn.ista.nl) account (Dutch ista portal)
- Home Assistant 2023.x or newer
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (recommended) or manual installation

---

## Installation

### Option A — HACS (recommended)

1. Click the **Add repository** button above, or go to **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories** and add:
   ```
   https://github.com/aalaei/ha-mijn-ista
   ```
   with category **Integration**.
2. Search for **ista Nederland (mijn.ista.nl)** in HACS and install it.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Click the **Set up integration** button above, or go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **ista Nederland**.

### Option B — Manual

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/aalaei/ha-mijn-ista/releases/latest).
2. Copy the `custom_components/mijn_ista/` folder into your `<config>/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **ista Nederland**.

---

## Configuration

Fill in the following fields when adding the integration:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Email** | Your mijn.ista.nl login e-mail address |
| **Password** | Your mijn.ista.nl password |
| **Language** | `English` or `Nederlands` — affects sensor names |
| **Update interval** | How often to poll the API (1–24 hours, default 24 h) |

> Credentials are validated against the live API before the entry is created.

The update interval can be changed later via **Settings → Devices & Services → ista Nederland → Configure** without re-adding the integration.

## Sensors in detail

### Annual sensors

The annual sensors show consumption for the current and previous billing year. The `Change` sensor is the relative difference in percent (positive = more consumption, negative = less).

Attributes on `{Service} Current` include the individual meter readings that make up the total.

### Monthly sensors

The `{Service} Month` sensor holds the most recent month's value. All prior months are available as attributes in the format:

```
attributes:
  2024-01: 42.3
  2024-02: 38.1
  ...
```

### Temperature sensors

Outdoor temperature data comes from KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) via the ista API. The value for the most recent month may be `unavailable` because KNMI data is finalized with a delay.

### Building averages

Building average sensors show the average consumption for your entire building or complex during the same period. Useful for comparing your own usage against your neighbours.

---

## Notes and limitations

- **Update frequency**: mijn.ista.nl data is updated every 3 days for smart meters, or monthly for traditional meters. Setting the poll interval shorter than 24 hours will not produce more up-to-date data.
- **No cost sensors**: The NL portal API does not expose billing amounts in euros — only consumption units (GJ, kWh, m³, etc.).
- **Dutch API**: Service names returned by the API are always in Dutch. When language is set to English, the integration translates them client-side (Verwarming → Heating, Warm water → Hot water, etc.). Unknown service names are passed through as-is.
- **Single property**: If your account has multiple properties (Cuid), each creates its own ista NL device.
- **German ista**: This integration is for the Dutch portal only. For the German ista portal, use the [ecotrend-ista](https://github.com/Ludy87/ecotrend-ista) integration.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Integration fails to set up | Wrong credentials — verify by logging in at mijn.ista.nl |
| All sensors unavailable | API unreachable or account suspended |
| Temperature sensor unavailable | KNMI data not yet finalized for the latest month — normal |
| Sensor values stale | mijn.ista.nl data updates every 3 days at most |

Enable debug logging to capture API responses:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.mijn_ista: debug
```
